  The following code implements one such recovery strategy. When an
  unexpected byte is encountered, the sequence up to that point will
  be replaced and, if the error occured in the middle of a sequence,
  will retry the byte as if it occured at the beginning of a
  string. Note that the idio_utf8_decode function detects errors as
  early as possible, so the sequence 0xED 0xA0 0x80 would result in
  three replacement characters.

for (prev = 0, current = 0; *s; prev = current, ++s) {

  switch (idio_utf8_decode(&current, &codepoint, *s)) {
  case IDIO_UTF8_ACCEPT:
    // A properly encoded character has been found.
    printf("U+%04X\n", codepoint);
    break;

  case IDIO_UTF8_REJECT:
    // The byte is invalid, replace it and restart.
    printf("U+FFFD (Bad UTF-8 sequence)\n");
    current = IDIO_UTF8_ACCEPT;
    if (prev != IDIO_UTF8_ACCEPT)
      s--;
    break;
  ...

  For some recovery strategies it may be useful to determine the
  number of bytes expected. The states in the automaton are numbered
  such that, assuming C's division operator, state / 3 + 1 is that
  number. Of course, this will only work for states other than
  IDIO_UTF8_ACCEPT and IDIO_UTF8_REJECT. This number could then be used, for
  instance, to skip the continuation octets in the illegal sequence
  0xED 0xA0 0x80 so it will be replaced by a single replacement
  character.

  idf: presumably state / 12 + 1 with the Rich Felker tweak.
