  ;; define some rt-command-status-error-handlers for the conditions
  ;; we are contriving to generate so that we can switch between them
  ;; as we go along

  ;; for exit0 we don't expect this code to be run at all -- hence
  ;; complaining loudly and testing for something that isn't generated
  ;; (spotting an error in the summary is easier to spot)

  ;; main monitor handler and the rcseh functions above) as we expect.

  ;; Remember, though, the test itself, as written in the rest of this
  ;; block, will increment Tests as well as any potential OOB handler.
  ;; The OOB handler will increment Tests twice: once to check the
  ;; condition is an rt-command-status-error and once in exit1/killed1
  ;; to verify the value of the status.
