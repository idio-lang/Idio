#*

POSIX regex(3) regular expressions.

We're not looking to test regcomp/regexec -- we can assume they work
-- we're looking to see if we successfully wrapper them.

Remember, Idio uses UTF-8 internally and regex(3) use your locale(7).
If your locale is not UTF-8 oriented then these tests may fail.

module test/posix-regex

posix-regex-0 := Tests

define (maybe-match->sexp rx str) {
  crx := regcomp rx
  res := regexec crx str
  and res (array->list res)
}

define (test-pre res rx str) {
  test (maybe-match->sexp rx str) res
}

str := "xababcy"

;; match
test-pre '("ab") "ab" str

;; no match
test-pre #f "xy" str

;; one sub-expression
test-pre '("abc" "ab") \
	"(ab)c" \
	str

;; two sub-expressions
test-pre '("xababc" "xa" "ab") \
	"(x[^b]*)b(.*)c" \
	str

;; nested sub-expressions
test-pre '("ababc" "abab" "ab") \
	"((ab)*)c" \
	str

;; empty sub-expression
test-pre '("c" "") \
	"(k*)c" \
	str

;; all done?
Tests? (posix-regex-0 + 6)
