#*

We have a bunch of test cases which should provoke a ^rt-glob-error
or ^rt-parameter-type-error.  So we can write a load function which
will wrapper the actual load with a trap for
(^rt-glob-error ^rt-parameter-type-error) and compare the message
strings.

*#

path-error-load := {
  n := 0

  function (filename msg) {
    if (not (string? filename)) (error 'load "not a string" filename)

    load-k := #n

    n = n + 1
    ;eprintf "loading #%s %s looking for %s\n" n filename msg
    trap (^rt-glob-error
	  ^rt-parameter-error) (function (c) {
				  ;eprintf "path-error #%s: %s %s\n" n msg c.location
				  test c.message msg

				  if (not (string=? c.message msg)) {
				    condition-report (append-string "path-error-load: " filename) c (current-error-handle)
				  }

				  load-k 'path-error
    }) {
      call/cc (function (k) {
		 load-k = k
		 (symbol-value 'load 'Idio) filename
      })
    }
  }
}

path-error-load "path-errors/pattern-bad-format.idio" "pattern contains an ASCII NUL"

;; all done?
Tests? (path-error0 + 1)
