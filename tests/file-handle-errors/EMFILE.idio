;; This code is very similar to the loop in test-file-handle.idio.
;; There we wanted to ensure that we could continue opening files.

;; Here we are looking to generate the specific error

;; FWIW open-file (with a mode string) tweaks a bit of code coverage
;; that open-input-file (with a fixed mode string) does not.
